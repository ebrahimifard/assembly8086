### Machine Language and System Programming


This is the repository of the coding exercises for the course Machine Language and System Programming. All the exercises are taken from "Introduction to 80x86 Assembly Language and Computer Architecture" by Richard Detmer.

1- Write a complete 80×86 assembly language program to prompt for values of x, y, and z and display the value of the expression x −2y + 4z. Allow for 16-bit integer values.

2- Write a complete 80×86 assembly language program to prompt for values of x, y, and z and display the value of the expression 2(−x + y−1) + z. Allow for 32-bit integer values.

3- Write a complete 80×86 assembly language program to prompt for the length and width of a rectangle and to display its perimeter (2*length + 2*width).

4- Write a complete 80×86 assembly language program to prompt for the length, width, and height of a box and to display its volume.

5- Write a complete 80×86 assembly language program to prompt for the length, width, and height of a box and to display its surface area.

6- Write a complete 80×86 program to input a positive integer value N and to display a table of integers from 1 to N and their squares. Use a two-column format.

7- Write a program that will input an integer, call procedure Root to find the integer square root, and display the value of the square root. 

8- Write a procedure GetValue that prompts for and inputs an integer between 0 and a specified size MaxValue. A main program must send MaxValue to the procedure in the EAX register. Procedure GetValue will return the integer it inputs in EAX. Procedure GetValue will repeatedly prompt for input until the user enters a value in the specified range. Write procedure GetValue so that EAX is the only register changed upon return to the calling program; even the flags register must be unchanged.

9- Write a procedure Min2 to find the minimum of two word-size integer parameters. Return the minimum in the AX register.

10- Write a procedure Max3 to find the maximum of three doubleword-size integer parameters. Return the maximum in the EAX register.

11- Suppose that someone has a certain number of coins (pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, fifty-cent pieces, and dollar coins) and wants to know the total value of the coins, as well as how many coins there are.
